# Polynomial_methods
Python functions to compute polynomial values, derivatives and Taylor's series and sum.

This Repository has the following content:
1) Poly_derivative.py which has two functions
    a) Function Poly_derivative computes the value of the polynomial P(x) or derivatives of a given order at some given x.
    b) poly_disp displays the polynomial expression given its coefficients.
    
2) Taylor_sum.py which has two functions:
    a) Taylor_terms computes a given term in the Taylor series expansion of the polynomial P(x) at x+delta_x.
    b) Taylor_sum computes the value of Taylor polynomial at a given x and delta_x.
